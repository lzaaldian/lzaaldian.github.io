title: Things to do after getting macOS
---

A new year is started and you might get a new Mac for your new year present. Or, maybe you want to reinstall your Mac because many applications installed and you feel that your OS is *dirty* so you want to clean them up and start *fresh*.
Whatever your reason, here are the things I do to get ready to develop applications in macOS from fresh install you might want to try.

### Update macOS

My MacBook Pro 13" 2017 comes with macOS High Sierra and I want to update or upgrade to the latest macOS available before installing any applications. I think this is important because some applications maybe not supported in the latest macOS.

### Install Fira Code fonts

Fonts with ligatures is perfect for code and I'm falling in love with [Fira Code fonts](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).

### Install Homebrew

![homebrew logo and description](/assets/images/homebrew-social-card.png)

I use Homebrew to install some tools needed for developing applications because installing them individually by downloading from its website then install it to my Mac is troublesome. Using Homebrew, installing a tool is just a command line away.

Try `brew install package_name` to install a package.

#### Tools installed using Homebrew

##### git-flow command

`git-flow` is a tool to help working with GitFlow workflow. Visit `git-flow` [GitHub page](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) for more information.

##### Node.js

This is an essential tool to develop web applications these days.

##### Other tools

- OpenJDK 8: I use [AdoptOpenJDK](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/homebrew-openjdk) to build Android applications using Cordova.
- Gradle: This one also needed to build Android applications using Cordova.

### Install packages via NPM

These are essential packages to support my development workflow.

- [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com): a style checker and linter for JavaScript. I adhere to this coding style in my projects.
- [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version): A changelog generator. This package adhere to [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org) and uses [`conventionalcommits preset`](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-config-spec).
- [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/): a tool to build mobile application using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS).

### Install Oh My Zsh

Since macOS Catalina, the default shell for Terminal app is Zsh. And by installing [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh), I can improve usability and appearance of the Terminal app because it has many great plugins and amazing themes to suit my desktop theme.

Oh-My-Zsh + [Node theme](https://github.com/skuridin/oh-my-zsh-node-theme) + Fira Code = Terminal above

### Install Sublime Text

Its simplicity and performance makes [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com) my favorite text editor.

Sublime Text + Fira Code + Monokai Pro + [some settings](https://gist.github.com/lzaaldian/8fda456f7683a70cc01aa1929276773b) = üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

#### Install Sublime Text Packages

These are the packages/plugins that make Sublime Text awesome for developing web applications.

- [Babel](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Babel): JavaScript compiler. A must have to build modern web application
- [DocBlockr](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/DocBlockr): multiline comments and function documentation made easy. I use [this settings](https://gist.github.com/lzaaldian/d33e6e0934dd1abeaefca98b698a7875) for generating function documentation.
- [EditorConfig](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/EditorConfig): general coding style configuration for various text editor or IDE.
- [Less syntax highlighting](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LESS)
- [Sass syntax highlighting](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Sass)
- [SublimeLinter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter): code linter bootstrap. We need to install the linter separately.
  - [SublimeLinter-contrib-standard](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-standard): JavaScript linter using JavaScript Standard Style.
  - [StandardFormat](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/StandardFormat): code formatter for JavaScript Standard Style.
  - [StandardSnippets](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/StandardSnippets): if using Babel as a default JavaScript syntax, the snippets from Sublime Text won't work. This package make it works again with JavaScript Standard Style.
- [Theme - Monokai Pro](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Monokai%20Pro): a perfect theme for Sublime Text.

### Install Sublime Merge

A companion application to Sublime Text. [Sublime Merge](https://sublimemerge.com) is a Git client which well integrated with Sublime Text but also great as a standalone app.

### Install Google Chrome

I use Google Chrome to debug Cordova application installed on Android device. And to test how the application looks like in Android device.

With your new Mac or refreshed Mac loaded with awesome tools, I hope you can enjoy developing great applications. Have fun and happy coding!.
