title: Read in Light Theme, Write in Dark Theme
---

With the dark theme rise in popularity, many people change everyting to dark theme including me. After a few months trying to *darken* everything, I find the downsides of the dark theme. Now, I'm trying to balance the dark and the light like in the Yin and Yang.

### Why Light Theme is Better for Reading

In my personal experience, reading articles or books is better when using light theme. Or better, sepia theme - the light brown color like paper in the books.
Even in the low light, the color still easy in the eyes and maintain syntax highlight if it has some code. Here's the comparison.

I use light theme to read digital paper like in Apple Books and articles on [Medium](https://medium.com) or websites.

### Why Dark Theme is Better for Coding or Writing

When writing for blog post or code, dark theme give the best visual appearance because it makes us focus on what in front of us and the appropriate syntax highlight makes it easier to spot something important.

My favorite dark theme is [Dracula Pro](https://draculatheme.com/pro). I think it has the best contrast and color palette for codes.
